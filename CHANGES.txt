# TODO LIST

FUTURE VERSION:
* Smarter CLT install status (version etc.)
* Use CoreData & NSArrayController to populate table view
* Filter search field menu with togglable matching of the various fields
* Extensive master search filters?
    * Date filters
    * Kind filters
* Only filter by columns that are enabled
* Show label color in result list
* Make label first class sort property. But how to rationally order multiple?
* Path bar with string option
* Customize interface size: small (like iTunes), normal (current) and large (w. previews f. images)
* Regex option for filter
* Customise drag items from table view (don't drag entire line, just icon w. name)
* Disable Finder actions for hidden files (and suggest showing hidden Files in Finder)

FOR 1.0

* Filter regex support - Should highlight strings that match
* Filter should search either all cols or name, menu option
* Highlight matching string when filter active, this looks great and is useful

* Use STPriviledTask when authenticated

* Action menu item titles should alter based on no. selected items etc.
* Detect when file no longer exists at path
* Contextual menu logic, use clicked item when one non-selected item is ctx-clicked
* Show volumes that don't have a catalog in volumes popup menu but visually identify them in some way
* Versions for multiple identical apps in Open With menu
* Interpret empty search string as request to find all files (find out how to list ALL files via searchfs function)
* Distinction between Alias/Symlink should be clear in "Kind" even if LaunchServices doesn't distinguish between them
* "Show Original" for aliases/symlinks
* Get Skip Package Contents working
* Open recent for status item menu
* Monospace font option
* Status Item app mode selection image should have a counterpart for non-dark mode
* Run comparison on searchfs results and those picked up by KatSearch parsing subprocess output
* Implement Search Filter menu options
* Text in table view should invert when selected in non-dark-mode
* Clear recent folders option
* Should selecting folder to search automatically start search matching *all* files in directory structure
* "Show Package Contents" option for packages
* Esc should clear filter even if filter text field is not first responder
* Detect whether volume or folder in recent search menu, show "in" for folder searches and "on" for volumes.
* Keyboard shortcut for new search window should match hotkey shortcut.
