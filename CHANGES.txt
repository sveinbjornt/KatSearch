# TODO LIST

FUTURE VERSION:

* Use CoreData & NSArrayController to populate table view
* Extensive master search filters?
    * Date filters
    * Kind filters
* Show label color in result list
* Make label first class sort property. But how to rationally order multiple?
* Path bar with string option
* Customize interface size: small (like iTunes), normal (current) and large (w. previews f. images)
* Customise drag items from table view (don't drag entire line, just icon w. name)
* Monospace font option
* Get Share in item contextual menu working
* Detect when file no longer exists at path
* Distinction between Alias/Symlink should be clear in "Kind" even if LaunchServices doesn't distinguish between them

* Support using /usr/bin/find for folders/non-searchfs-capable volumes
* Use STPriviledTask when authenticated

* Action menu item titles should alter based on no. selected items etc.
* Contextual menu logic, use clicked item when one non-selected item is ctx-clicked
* Show volumes that don't have a catalog in volumes popup menu but visually identify them in some way
* Move Open With menu functionality to NSWorkspace additions
* Interpret empty search string as request to find all files (find out how to list ALL files via searchfs function)

* Run comparison on searchfs results and those picked up by KatSearch parsing subprocess output

* Clear recent folders option
* Should selecting folder to search automatically start search matching *all* files in directory structure?
* Esc should clear filter even if filter text field is not first responder

* Keyboard shortcut for new search window should match hotkey shortcut.
* Quick Look for items. Mostly nice for images

* Disable Finder actions for hidden files (and suggest showing hidden Files in Finder)

DONE * Show Filter should not be a global defaults option
DONE * Truncate ultra-long filenames when they're shown in item contextual menu
